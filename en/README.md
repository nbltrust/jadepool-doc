### Support Multiple Chains&Tokens
Jadepool Hub supports multiple cryptocurrencies and each of them has its own uniqueness. Jadepool Hub is designed as a general system that supports different blockchains while maintaining high efficiency. It could be either the Jadepool Hub team or the third party to implement if a new blockchain needs to be supported.

### Separate Cold Storage
As hot wallet, Jadepool Hub must be equipped with hardware cold wallet. Certain percentage of the total assets can be safely separated and stored in the cold wallet depending on the client's needs. The rest are of liquidity, thus meeting the need of users to withdraw at any time.

### High Performance
Modularization and micro-service enables Jadepool Hub to support distributed deployment, that means a server can be fully used for monitoring and processing requests for only one chain. This lowers the risk as much as improves the software efficiency.

### Local Deployment 
With Jadepool Hub deployed individually on site, the client takes control of all data and can customize configurations based on own needs. All components are dockerized so the whole deployment process is quick and easy.       

### HSM 
HSM, developed by NBLTrust, is an application data security hardware customized for Jadepool Hub. HSM is a physically secure hardware and it takes the key security role of generating and storing seed, deriving and recovering private keys, verifying requests, signing transactions and storing critical
data. 

### Third-party Implementation
Third-party implementation means, Jadepool Hub’s business partners are able to individually develop to support new blockchains based on the micro-service structure. The implementation will be shared within the Jadepool Hub eco-system.   

### Admin Management
Admin, a management system designed and developed for Jadepool Hub, is provided to client for
monitoring Jadepool Hub running status. Clients are able to view orders, check balance, audit, customize
configuration, manage roles and users etc., depending on different levels of role permission.

### Audit
Jadepool Hub provide audit feature to make sure assets security and data consistency. Client is able to use audit API or log in admin to see real-time audit results, or even enable scheduled audit and download report once the audit is automatically done.
